To give a bit of context on the available data and which ones we used to develop our data story, we provide some background about the used dataset. It is worth mentioning that our initial bases was the CMU dataset, that we decided to expand to the **IMDb dataset**, because it makes the study more effective and representative, given the way larger amount of data. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a dataset containing information about movie titles, release dates, actors, ratings etc., founded in 1990 and then transferred to the Web in 1993. **The dataset contains more than 10 million titles from all over the world** and it is often used in research and development projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing, as it provides a large and comprehensive set of data that can be used to train and test algorithms. **The focus of the present analysis is the region of the United States**, namely we are considering movies released in the US.

Specifically, IMDb is divided into sub-sets of data, each containing different information about the movie industry, and linkable one to the other through predefined ids. The sub-sets we used are: **'title.akas.tsv.gz'** containing movie titles and regions of release, **'name.basics.tsv.gz'** containing the list of actors and the respective movies they starred in, **'title.crew.tsv.gz'** with the names of the directors for each movie, **'title.ratings.tsv.gz'** with the list of movies ratings and number of votes, and **'title.basics.tsv.gz'**, containing the genres of the movies. All the cited datasets were cleaned and merged to extract the features of interest for the analysis.
