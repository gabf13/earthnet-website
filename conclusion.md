In conclusion, in this project, we have conducted an observational study to  the effects of an actor's success on its movie ratings 

In this study, we focused on assesssing what are the potential confounders related with actor success and their impact on movie ratings. After qualitatively defining rich cirlce and  exploring the covariates to IMDB grades, possible confounders and analyzing the ones that we believe are the main confounders. This involved conducting an observational study to identify patterns and trends in actor's job assignment based on quantified covariates.
In simpler terms, we have performed a propensity score matching that limits previously mentionned covariates & we have concluded that the correlation of being part of succesful cirlce of actors (coming from the treatment group) and IMDB grades is reduced when the influence of the confounders are limited. A less pronounced Star System is observed when we perform this matching. Finally, to further assess the potential limitations of our analysis we developped a strategy to address the confounder of certain actor's having their career's boosted by acting with more succesful actors. While studying, this phenomenon that we have dubbed = "Piggy-backing", we have deduced that the identified piggy-backing actors have a greater IMDB grade average than the non "leeching" actors in our less succesful actors.
