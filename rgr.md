# Rich-get-Richer Mechanism

In this section we analyze the distributions of significant parameters to assess actor success and we give a possible explanation for such behaviors. It is indeed interesting to qualitatively understand **why actors' success can be influenced by external factors** and not only by the quality of the actors' work.

We observed that the distribution of actors' careers number of movie appearances is strongly skewed. It is interesting to notice that it follows a **power law, given that is linear in the logarithmic domain**. Moreover, the **typical exponential tail** in the semilogarithmic y domain is visually observable.

To statistically prove that the distribution follows a power law we perform a **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the tail of the distribution**. The results are here shown. Given the **p-values larger than 0.05** we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the distribution is exponential.
   
| Dataset   | KS test  | p-value |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| Overall   | 0.32     | 0.11    |

An explanation for the **onset of a power law** can be given. Just as normal distributions arise from many independent random decisions averaging out, **power laws can arise from the feedback introduced by correlated decisions across a population** [1]. 
    
**Successful actors keep starring with other successful actors**, making them even more successful and naturally generating a power law in actors' productivity, namely the number of appearances in movies. **Most of the movies are generated by a minority of actors**. Around **20% of the actors make 80% of the movies**. Given the large amount of data considered (IMDb movies in the US region), the dataset can be considered to be **representative for the actors' population** (it involves 66457 actors and 97962 movies after the data cleaning).
    
This mechanism makes it difficult to quantify the impact of actors on movies, because of the **large amount of possible confounders** that influence the probability of an actor joining this 'rich-get-richer' loop. **What are these possible confounders?**
