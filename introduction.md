# Introduction

**Have you ever watched a movie because an actor was starring in it?** It is no secret that good actors lead to good movies. This phenomenon is also known as the **star system** and was started in Hollywood in the 1920s with the goal of exploiting the image of actors to promote movies and generate publicity. Our project aims at investigating the factors that make the star system. In other words, investigate the factors that make successful actors impact the ratings of movies by identifying covariates & the confounders hidden in the process and quantfiying their impact on the star system. Firstly, let's define a few things:

### What makes an actor successful?
**Successful actors are able to make a living out of their acting career**, and even if this seems normal for any other job, in the movie industry, **a huge part of the actors' population are 'one-hit wonders'**, actors that have starred only once and did not manage to make their career take off. By extension, we see that a minority of the actors, detains most of the roles & jobs, **generating a natural power law in actors' movie appearances**.
**How do these different categories of actors impact the ratings of the movies they star in? What are the possible confounders playing a role in the mechanism?** For the plan of our project, at first the possible confounders are discussed and analyzed in detail, to understand the mechanisms at the basis of actors' job assigment and to have an idea of which factors are to be attributed to the merit of the actor and which ones to external influences. Afterwards, **an observational study is carried out in order to limit these confounders** from affecting an actor's ability to join the 'richer' circle of actors and to **verify if such actors positively impact movie ratings**. Put simply, how well the star system is verified once the confounders & covariates are limited. Lastly, we discuss the effects of a more complex confounder which has its basis in co-acting and analyze how it affects the star system (the effect that top actors have on the movie ratings).

### Research questions
#### Which are the possible confounders to be tackled in assessing the characteristics of successful actors?
* What defines the success of an actor?
* How are movie ratings and successful actors related between each other?
* How are networks of actors formed and do acting pairs show disparity in their success metrics?
